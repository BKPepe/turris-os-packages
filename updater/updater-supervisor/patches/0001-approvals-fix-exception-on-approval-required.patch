Subject: [PATCH 1/2] approvals: fix exception on approval required

The autorun.auto_approve_time() returns None in case of approvals are
required. Instead of checking if it is not None we checked old condition
and that if it is larger than 0.

This was casing update blockage in case approvals were configured as
required.
